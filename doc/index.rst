Welcome to SoCo's documentation!
===================================================

SoCo (Sonos Controller) is a high level Python 2/3 library to control your
`Sonos <www.sonos.com>`_ Â® speakers with::

    # Import soco and get a SoCo instance
    import soco
    device = soco.discovery.any_soco()

    # Get all albums from the music library that contains the word "Black"
    # and add them to the queue
    albums = device.music_library.get_albums(search_term='Black')
    for album in albums:
        print('Added:', album.title)
        device.add_to_queue(album)

    # Dial up the volume (just a bit) and play
    device.volume += 10
    device.play()
